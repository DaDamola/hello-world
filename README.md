# hello-world

I am a senior computer science student aspiring to become a machine learning or virtual/augmented reality engineer that improves the current technology being used for augmented experiences, designs virtual reality learning environments, and employs algorithms to build reliable autonomous vehicles.

I am presently scouring for an internship in AI/VR/AR. In the meantime, I  am working on learning more relevant programming languages, mastering the languages I already know, and coding up new projects from scratch.

In my free time, I enjoy writing poems about my worldly experiences, running or playing soccer.
