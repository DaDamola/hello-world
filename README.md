# hello-world

Hi, I am a senior computer science student aspiring to become a machine learning or virtual/augmented reality engineer that improves
the current technology being used for augmented experiences, designs virtual reality learning environments, and employs algorithmns
and techniques to build reliable autonomonous vehicles. 

I am presently scouring for an internship in AI/VR/AR. In the meantime, I working on learning more revelant languages, mastering the languages I already know, and coding up new projects from scratch. 

In my free time, I enjoy writing poems about my worldly experiences, running or playing soccer.
